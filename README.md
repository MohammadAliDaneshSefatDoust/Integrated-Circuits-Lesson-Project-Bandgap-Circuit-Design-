# Integrated-Circuits-Lesson-Project-Bandgap-Circuit-Design-
0.Problem statement:
You are to design the bandgap voltage reference circuit shown in Fig. 1 with the following specifications:
•	Output reference voltage: VRef = 0.5 V
•	Power supply voltage (VDD): 1.0 V to 1.5 V
•	Temperature range: -40C to 85C
•	Maximum output voltage variation due to temperature variations: < 10 mV
•	Power supply voltage rejection ratio (PSRR): > 30 dB @ 10 Hz
•	Technology: 90 nm CMOS
•	Power dissipation: as low as possible
The key design objective is minimizing the power dissipation while meeting all design requirements.
The circuit is to be simulated in HSPICE using TSMC 90 nm CMOS technology by checking the
performance at different process corner cases including slow, nominal, and fast models for both nMOS
and pMOS devices as well as temperature variations spanning from -40C to 85C. In overall, you are to
report all the simulated results in a table at least in three different cases: TT @ 27C, SS @ 85C, and FF
@ -40C.
